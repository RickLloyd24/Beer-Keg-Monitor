# ESP32 D1 R32

These boards are made by Wemos and HiLetgo.  They are older designs.  I would not recomend them for a new project the ESP32 development modules are much better.  I have also found that the Wi-Fi antenna is much better on the development modules.  I used this board because I have several lying around.
