# VGA Interface

For this project I selected a VGA monitor for my local display. VGA monitors
are large and easy to read for my guests. They are also readily available and
cheap. I got mine free at a garage sale. They were closing up and the monitor
was still there, so they gave it to me. I also bought a VGA monitor at a thrift
store for 10 dollars.

## VGA Interface Schematic

The following is the schematic for the VGA interface:

The resistors for the RGB signals should have a 2 to 1 ratio. The values
don't seem to be very important. The resistors in the above schematic were just
some that I had laying around. I did another project and used all 220-ohm
resistors because I had a lot of them. I used two resistors in series for the
"0" signals and one for the "1" signals. Both displays were
sharp and clear.

The 47-ohm resistors are for impedance matching.

With this configuration you can theoretically get 64 colors. For my project
I used 16 different colors.

## Software

For this project I used the FabGL Graphics Library for ESP32.  This library is great!  I used the same library for my keyboard interface.  The library overview is at the following link  [www.FabGL.com](http://www.fabgl.com/)Â  and is also available on Github.  I used the default pin numbers as defined in the library.
